## Overview

SoundAlign is an NVDA add-on that significantly enhances the audio feedback experience by letting users fully customize the **stereo panning** of all major sound categories produced by NVDA and its add-ons.

It includes a dedicated settings panel where you can adjust sound direction, waveform type, fade algorithm, volume, and frequency ranges — especially for progress indicators — to create a perfectly tailored auditory environment.

## Hot Keys

- **NVDA + Windows + S** (single press) → Open the SoundAlign settings panel.

- **NVDA + Windows + S** (double press) → Quickly **turn SoundAlign on or off**.

## Features

### Customizable Sound Panning

Adjust the stereo position (**left, center, right**) for each of the following sound types:

- Error sounds (e.g., spelling error beeps, alerts)
- General NVDA sound effects
- Navigation sounds (first/last line boundary beeps, etc.)
- Beeps coming from other NVDA add-ons
- Progress indicators (with dynamic left↔right or right↔left sweeping)

### Waveform Customization

Choose the tone of progress indicator sounds:

- **Sine** (smooth, flute-like)
- **Triangle**
- **Sawtooth**

### Fade Algorithms

Select the smoothing curve for progress bar sounds:

- **Cosine** fade
- **Gaussian** fade

### Volume and Frequency Control

Fine-tune progress indicator sounds:

- Volume: from **0.1** to **1.0**
- Minimum frequency: **110–300 Hz**
- Maximum frequency: **1200–1750 Hz**
